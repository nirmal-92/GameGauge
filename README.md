Football match prediction is a popular area of study in sports analytics, involving the use of historical data and statistical models to forecast the outcomes of football matches. The main goal of this project is to build a machine learning model capable of predicting the result of a match—either a win, loss, or draw—based on various features extracted from past games, player statistics, and team performance.

Machine learning (ML) is particularly effective for this task due to its ability to learn from patterns within large datasets. By training an ML model on historical data, the project aims to capture complex relationships between factors like team strength, recent performance, player conditions, and match location, among others.
